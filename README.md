# Fast Lexical Analyzer
This project is a Flex-based program designed to categorize grammars and automata, created as part of the Formal Languages and Automata course. The program processes grammar rules and automaton definitions to classify them into categories such as regular, context-free, or context-sensitive, and display information about the grammars and automata. It analyzes a given grammar and automaton, identifying key elements such as variables, domains, production rules, transition functions, and states. The code is written in C++ and leverages Flex for lexical analysis, handling the parsing and classification of formal grammars efficiently.
